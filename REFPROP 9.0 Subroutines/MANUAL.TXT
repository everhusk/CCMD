USING REFPROP WITH OTHER PROGRAMS

The subroutines are contained in a number of files, which are placed in the
REFPROP\FORTRAN directory.  The following files should be compiled and linked with
your own main program:

core_anc.for  core_bwr.for   core_cpp.for   core_de.for    core_ecs.for
core_feq.for  core_mlt.for   core_ph0.for   core_pr.for    core_stn.for
core_qui.for
flash2.for    flsh_sub.for   idealgas.for   mix_aga8.for   mix_hmx.for
prop_sub.for  realgas.for    sat_sub.for    setup.for      setup2.for
trns_ecs.for  trns_tcx.for   trns_vis.for   trnsp.for      utility.for

These 26 files were compiled with the Lahey compiler using a command similar
to this:
   lf95 core_anc.for -c -nco -nom -dll -win -ml msvb
and linked with the following:
   lf95 pass_ftn.obj setup.obj core_anc.obj core_bwr.obj core_cpp.obj core_de.obj core_ecs.obj core_feq.obj core_mlt.obj core_ph0.obj core_qui.obj core_stn.obj core_pr.obj flash2.obj flsh_sub.obj idealgas.obj mix_aga8.obj mix_hmx.obj prop_sub.obj realgas.obj sat_sub.obj setup2.obj trns_ecs.obj trns_tcx.obj trns_vis.obj trnsp.obj utility.obj   -nco -nom -dll -win -ml msvb -out refprop.dll

There is one additional file that comes with REFPROP.  This file, called
pass_ftn.for, is used only when creating the DLL.

Several example files showing how to call the routines are located in your
REFPROP\Examples directory.  EXAMPLE.FOR shows the common routines that you
might need.  EX-MIX.FOR shows how to load a mixture .MIX file containing
information for specified blends of refrigerants (and air).  The file
EX-PPF.FOR shows how to use the pseudo-pure fluid files.

In version 8.0, any fluids that are used must have a ".fld" extension, e.g.,
R134a.fld, or a ".ppf" extension, e.g., air.ppf.  In 8.1 and later versions, the
.fld extension is no longer needed and assumed if missing.  The file HMX.BNC
(containing mixture parameters) must also be present.  It is suggested (but not
required) that these be put into a subdirectory called "fluids" under the
directory containing the subroutines and application program.

The subroutine SETUP must be called to initialize the pure fluid or mixture
components.  The call to SETUP will allow the choice of one of three standard
reference states for entropy and enthalpy and will automatically load the
NIST-recommended models for the components as well as mixing rules.  The
routine SETMOD allows the specification of other models.  To define another
reference state, or to apply one of the standard states to a mixture of a
specified composition, the subroutine SETREF may be used.  These additional
routines should be called only if the fluids and/or models (or reference state)
are changed.  The sequence is:

call SETMOD    (optional)
call SETUP     (REQUIRED)         [or call SETMIX]
call SETKTV    (optional)
call SETREF    (optional)

Subroutine SETUP0 calls subroutine SETUP using the same techniques as those
used by the graphical interface and the Excel spreadsheet.  Subroutine
SETMIX reads the *.MIX files and makes the appropriate call to subroutine
SETUP.  Subroutine SETPATH sets the path where the *.fld files can be
found.  Subroutine PUREFLD allows the user to calculate the properties of a
pure fluid when a mixture has been loaded and the fluid is one of the
constituents in the mixture.

Units.  The subroutines use the following units for all inputs and outputs:

temperature                     K
pressure, fugacity              kPa
density                         mol/L
composition                     mole fraction
quality                         mole basis (moles vapor/total moles)
enthalpy, internal energy       J/mol
Gibbs, Helmholtz free energy    J/mol
entropy, heat capacity          J/(mol.K)
speed of sound                  m/s
Joule-Thomson coefficient       K/kPa
d(p)/d(rho)                     kPa.L/mol
d2(p)/d(rho)2                   kPa.(L/mol)^2
viscosity                       microPa.s (10^-6 Pa.s)
thermal conductivity            W/(m.K)
dipole moment                   debye
surface tension                 N/m

Note:  The only exceptions to the above are the conversion utilities
       XMASS and XMOLE.  The graphical interface allows a wide variety
       of units, but not the subroutines.

Naming conventions.  The variable type of subroutine arguments can
generally be inferred from the first letter of the variable name:

a-g and o-z:  double precision
h:            double precision (i.e. enthalpy) or character
i-k and m,n:  integer
l:            logical (within subroutines only, no logicals in
              arguments), also used as integer for exponent of FEQ model

The property subroutines are written in ANSI standard Fortran 77 and are
compatible with Fortran 90.  We are striving to make these as standard and
portable as possible, but every compiler has its own sensitive points.
Please report any compiler or linker errors or warnings.

Potential pitfalls:

The fluid data files are read using logical unit 12.  Use of this unit
in your program may crash the program and should be avoided.

Below are descriptions of the high-level routines that could be used in
stand-alone applications.  These routines will give you access to all features
in a model-independent fashion.  There are corresponding low-level routines for
some of these that call specific models.  Please do not incorporate the
low-level routines into your applications--if you do, you may find that future
versions may not work the same.

The FORTRAN routines return warning and error codes and messages when the input
conditions are out of range or the calculations fail.  The error codes are
integers returned in the subroutine argument ierr.  When a calculation is
successful, the value of ierr is 0. Negative values of ierr signify a warning
(that is, a condition where calculations were completed) but the results may be
suspect.  The most common warning would be for a temperature or pressure
slightly above the limits of the property model.

Errors imply conditions for which the calculations failed (such as an iteration
not converging) or for which calculations are not possible (such as a negative
pressure or a mixture composition not summing to one).  Many property models
give nonsensical results when extrapolated to lower temperatures and/or higher
densities; thus errors are also issued when the temperature is below the limit
of the model or the density is above the limit.  The codes for errors are
positive numbers.

More detailed messages (including, in some cases, a report of the input
condition(s) that resulted in the warning or error) are available via the output
variable herr, which may be printed or displayed using the subroutine ERRMSG.
In the graphical interface, errors are displayed in an Alert box.  If the
calculation of a table results in a warning, a message is displayed at the
completion of the calculations, and the individual messages can be displayed by
clicking the mouse on the number of the affected row.

c           'IIR':  h = 200, s = 1.0 for sat liq at 0 C (IIR convention)
c           other choices are possible, but these require a separate

c
c     call the SETUP routine with the same inputs as SETUP except for

c     it simply contains the name of the fluid file (with a path if needed).
c     For a mixture, it contains the names of the constituents in the
c     mixture separated by a |.  For the air mixture, this would be

      subroutine PUREFLD (icomp)
c
c  Change the standard mixture setup so that the properties of one fluid
c  can be calculated as if SETUP had been called for a pure fluid.
c  Calling this routine will disable all mixture calculations.
c  To reset the mixture setup, call this routine with icomp=0.
c

c  be set to 3 to calculate properties for just the first three components.
c  This also allows a mixture to be setup with one or more pure fluids
c  loaded after the components in the mixture.  For example, R407C could
c  be loaded by calling setup with R32.fld, R125.fld, R134a.fld, and R407C.ppf.
c  The number of components would be set to 3, and PUREFLD would be called

c  calling SETUP.
c
c  inputs:
c        i--flag specifying use of PR:

c               (not currently working)
c           2 - Use Peng-Robinson equation for all calculations
c           if i=-1, then i is returned with current usage of PR:  0, 1, or 2.
c




      subroutine SETAGA (ierr,herr)
c

c  set to 2, and only one root is found in the vapor (this occurs when s<scrit)
c  the state point will be placed in k2,t2,p2,d2.  If kph=0 and this situation
c  occurred, the first root (k1,t1,p1,d1) would be in the liquid (k1=1, k2=2).

c  The third root is the root with the lowest temperature.  For fluids
c  with multiple roots:  When only one root is found in the vapor phase
c  (this happens only at very low temperatures past the region where three
c  roots are located), the value of the root is still placed in
c  k3,t3,p3,d3.  For fluids that never have more than one root (when there
c  is no maximum entropy along the saturated vapor line), the value of the
c  root is always placed in k1,t1,p1,d1.

FLASH SUBROUTINES

So-called "flash" calculations involve a determination of the
thermodynamic state, given two independent variables plus composition.
In addition to the inputs of temperature and pressure, which is the most
common flash calculation, REFPROP provides routines for virtually all
combinations of temperature, pressure, or density as the first variable
and density, internal energy, enthalpy, entropy, or quality as the
second variable.  The combination of enthalpy and entropy is also
supported.

Flash subroutines are provided for cases where the state is known to be
single phase (liquid or vapor) or two-phase (liquid plus vapor), and
also for the general case where the phase is not known.  Because of the
many combinations and their parallel structure, these routines are
described in groups.  The first two letters of the subroutine name
indicate the independent variables, where

      T = temperature [K]
      P = pressure [kPa]
      D = density [mol/L]
      E = internal energy [J/mol]
      H = enthalpy [J/mol]
      S = entropy [J/mol-K]
      Q = vapor quality [moles vapor/total moles]
          or [kg vapor/total kg] depending on the
          value of the input flag kq

SINGLE-PHASE FLASH SUBROUTINES

These routines accept only single-phase states as inputs.  They will be

called outside the range of the equation of state.  The following
two-phase routines are available.

c  result in only a warning. Most equations of state may be

c           if multiple inputs are outside limits, ierr = abs[sum(ierr)]
c           with the sign determined by the most severe excursion

c           root where derivative of spline with respect to rho is equal to the
c           the value of f (set f=0 to find maximum or minimum)
c        f--value of spline function
c  outputs:
